# UX Portfolio

My name is Elias Legato, this is my first semester here at Chico, I am transfering from Cuesta College in San Luis Obispo. 
I am a computer science major who looks forward to taking this class. I enjoy playing video games in my spare time.
Some of the games I play are Valorant, War Thunder, Escape From Tarkov, CSGO, and VTOLVR. I also enjoy outdoor activities
like hiking or swiming.
