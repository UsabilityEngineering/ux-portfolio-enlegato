# First Journal Entry...
When I want a sandwich I usually order from Ike’s, to expedite the ordering and retrieval of my sandwich I order using their app. With other mobile ordering apps usually your device's location is used to find the nearest location of an establishment. When I first used the application instead of using my location I had to manually type out my location and find the nearest Ike’s location. Now I still have to go through 3 different screens after clicking order now to start my order.

Then once you have your order, only sometimes does it take you to the basket to complete the order. Navigating there requires you to go back to the home screen and the cart icon. Overall it is frustrating and not very learnable. My mental model built up by using other food ordering apps did not match my experience with the app. There were no errors, just frustration with the app which is why I don’t order online using it anymore. 
one more gripe with the app is that it doesn't have the correct hours on it, Ike's in chico is not open on mondays and tuesdays.
