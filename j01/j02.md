# Second Journal Entry...
Recording software is kind of its own beast when it comes to mental maps because most people don't use them. When I first installed OBS (Open Broadcast Software) I didn't know how to use it in the slightest, it had a record button but nothing was being recorded when I clicked it. Now after using it for a few years I expect any recoding software to be the same as OBS with the same features. When I first opened the app there was nothing to tell me what I should do. here is a screenshot of what I found:

After that I didn't know what a source was but I clicked the + button because there was a promt to. when a menu apeared I didn't know what to click:

However after consulting a guide the app became much more simple. By clicking display capture you gain a window prompting you to name it and to select a display:

That is the most simple use of this app, however you can tweak many more settings to get the exact recording result you want:

However as a normal user the only settings screen you will end up using is the output screen:

On the output screen you have two parts, the streaming screen and the recording screen. The streaming screen is for the bitrate of the recorded video or the bitrate of the stream you are outputing if you want to use the software for live streaming. you can change the video encoder, which on a basicl level is how your computer reders the video. This matters for people who want to live stream games because certain encoding methods can have lesser impacts on your system while gaming.
I enjoy this industry standard app and after years of using I still havent used it to its fullest, If you want some good screen recording/streaming software I would highly reccomend this software because it offers great video and audio quality and can output in almost any video format. My mental model of recording software has been built off of this app, it is not the most learnable but the basic functionality requires minimal learning.
